Some thoughts on detecting the polarisation of the Crab pulsar 
using MeqTrees.
==============================================================
J.E.Noordam, Dwingeloo, 9 June 2006


Hi Sarod,

I have had some further discussions with Ger about this subject, and
decided to write down a summary for myself. Ger is reducing things in
NEWSTAR, but we have a suspicion that you will be able to do better
with MeqTrees. Ger has already said that he will be impressed, so that
is a good incentive. Since this project is also highly relevant for
CS1 and further LOFAR work, I am distributing this summary to the
entire MeqTree group, for information. (Perhaps I should put it on the
Wiki eventually). In the meantme, you and I can compare notes next
tuesday.

Some numbers:

  -) Crab flux (elliptic gaussian): ~1500 Jy @ 150 MHz
     (it is NOT polarised)
  -) Crab pulsar (point source): ~17 Jy @ 150 MHz
  -) Pulsar polarised flux: 
          varies from ~2.5 Jy @ 140 MHz 
                   to ~1.0 Jy @ 117 MHz

  -) Faraday rotation causes Q to be converted to U
     and vice-versa
  -) The Faraday rotation angle varies as:
         phi(t,f) = phi0 + (RMint+RMion(t))*(lambda^2)
     in which RM is the Rotation Measure (rad/m2)
     (So, the period mentioned below is propto f^3)   
  -) Intrinsic Crab pulsar farot: RMint ~ 45 rad/m2
     This causes the linear polarisation to alternate
     sinusoidally between Q and U as a function of freq
        The period is ~1.1 MHz @ 140 MHz
                      ~0.7 MHz @ 117 MHz
  -) Ionospheric Faraday rotation: RMint ~ 1 rad/m2
     the latter varies slowly in time.

  -) Noise per sample (10 kHz, 10 s): 30 Jy
     So the Crab itself has a high S/N, but the pulsar
     polarisation is below the noise/sample.
  -) WSRT spectral window (8 total): 2.5 MHz each
     So a subband has 256 channels (sqrt(256)=16).
  -) The visibility function of the Crab nebula is a 
     gaussian(u), with half-maximum @ baseline=500m.
  -) The visibility function of the pulsar is constant
     (point source), and will dominate on the longer
     baselines (albeit below the noise, of course).
  -) There are a number of other sources in the field,
     with a maximum flux of ~10 Jy. They are not polarised. 
  -) The WSRT has considerable instrumental polarisation. 
     In addition to on-axis leakage (DJones), there are 
     also off-axis effects, including the 17 MHz ripple. 


Data:

  -) XX = gix(f,t) * gjx(f,t) * (I(f) + Q*sin(2pi*f/P + phi0)) 

  -) YY = giy(f,t) * gjy(f,t) * (I(f) - Q*sin(2pi*f/P + phi0)) 

  -) XY = gix(f,t) * gjy(f,t) * (dij*I(f) - U*sin(2pi*f/p + phi0)) 

  -) YX = giy(f,t) * gjx(f,t) * (dij*I(f) + U*sin(2pi*f/P + phi0)) 

  -) The period P is the 0.7-1.1 MHz mentioned above

  -) We will operate on one 2.5 MHz WSRT subband at a time. This
  covers 2-4 full periods P.

  -) To first order, we may assume that Q,U,T are constant over such a
  2.5 MHz subband.

  -) To first order, we may assume that he instrumental frequency
  dependence (GJones, BJones, EJones) is smooth over a subband. In any
  case it will have a different signature from the highly predictable
  (except for phi0?) sin(f/P+phi0) signature of the pulsar polarisation.


Experiments:

  -) There is no need in this stage to include the WHAT station. In a
  later stage, the WHAT might offer certain calibration advantages
  because of its dipole orientations. But the S/N will be even lower
  than for WSRT baselines.


Experiment 1:

  -) If we solve per timeslot for GJones(f,t), with a 2nd-3rd order
  freq polynomial over the subband, we will remove most of the G,B,E
  effects. Of course we should ignore the outer 10% of the subband.

  -) The sin(f/P) signature should be (just) visible by eye in the
  XX and YY condeq residuals, especially the longer baselines.

  -) They might even be visible on the XY and YX residuals
