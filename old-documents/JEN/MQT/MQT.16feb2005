           Topics this week
	   ================

Operation 343. See below. 


           ===================
           Operation 343 (MAB) 
           ===================

The solver problem has been solved (by MXM). MAB has asked Adriaan to
write a Glish flagger for him (with which we should be able to compete
in the not too distant future). Any other obstacles? MAB will report.


           ================
           Water-hole (RXA)
           ================

RXA has laid the keel of a gui-based MeqTree builder (in Python). 
It looks very nice, and will be a great help to newcomers.

However, the tools for selecting and executing water-hole trees is
urgent. Especially the request editor, which should also be available
from the browser (re-execute mode) as a plugin.

JEN has pre-loaded canned forests to contribute.


           =============
           MeqParm (MXM)
	   =============

MXM has started on her MeqParm document. JEN has supplied some of the
input figures. By simply playing with existing trees and the browser,
she may already have identified the recent problem with the solver....

She has also made her first node classes (MeqWSum and MeqWMean), which
still have to be tested. They will be used in the selfcal phase
constraint equation (sum of subset of phases is zero). We still need a
dynamic way to modify the weight vector. One solution is a special
node that makes a weight vector from their children, and passes it to
its parent in the rider of its result... (Good Design?). We need a
similar thing for the MeqSolver, to apply weights to the condeq
equations.
 
The most effective start for the MeqParm project is probably a MeqParm
fiddler plugin (Python), which can be used stand-alone and from the
browser. Apart from modifying the coefficients of a particular MeqParm,
it can also visualise its current value, e.g. in a 3D plot. Onve it
exists in its basic from (and the Python hurdle is taken), it can grow
from there. As a byproduct, MXM, RXA and AGW can work develop their
browser plugins in parallel, while OM writes documentation on the
subject.


She is assisting RJN with the design of the uvbrick node.


           ==============
	   uv-brick (RJN)
	   ==============

RJN will summarize the status.
   

	   ===================
           Visualisation (AGW)
	   ===================

AGW will report on the status.


           ==============================================
	   Local Sky Model (LSM) and related issues (RJN)
	   ==============================================

RJN has started on a document (with JEN) that describes the contents
and the various functions of the LSM.
 

           ===================== 
           Tree generation (JEN)
	   =====================

JEN has been feeding pre-loaded 'mqbm' (MeqBenchMark) trees to AGW,
for testing visualisation.  They are available to all and sundry in
the water-hole.

           ======================
	   Global Sky Model (TAO)
	   ======================

Very little work has gone into the GSM until now. The only thing we
know is that we will need one for LOFAR. We suspect that we need one
for serious use of the MeqTree system for WSRT observations. In any
case, a working prototype is needed before we start on the LOFAR GSM.

There are three main aspects to the GSM project:

  1) Designing and implementing it (and its interaction with the LSM)

  2) Filling it with initial data from existing surveys, especially
  combining observations at different times/freqs in funklets.

  3) Using it operationally.

It is time to start thinking about all that....



           ===================
           Facet imaging (WNB)
	   ===================

This is imaging in the narrow sense, i.e. just the transform of
'corrected' uv-data into residual image(s).  For the moment, we can
get by with the present AIPS++ imaging, but it is essential that
someone takes a hard look at the suitability in the medium term, and
eventually for LOFAR. WNB will get involved after in April, or
thereabouts.

	   ========
           GraphViz
	   ========

OMS has found a graph visualisation tool (http://www.graphviz.org/)
that might become a yet another corner-stone of our system:

   -) It can be used to build forests interactively in the kernel by
   combining it with the tool that RXA is writing. Such trees could be
   tested at each state by executing them with some request.

   -) It can display any forest that is loaded in the kernel. We must
   look into its capabilities to organise the graph into a super-graph
   of sub-units that can be expanded for closer inspection.

   -) More interestingly, it could be used to edit forests in the
   kernel, i.e. to insert nodes, or to replace nodes or subtrees.

   -) More specifically, it could be used to adapt forests to a given
   LSM manually, by stringing 'peeling-units' after each other, and
   linking them to specific LSM sources/patches. This could be a
   short-term solution for a tricky problem.

The tool is written in such a way that the graph can be separated from
the viewing tool. It can be easily intergrated in the browser. OMS has
installed it on lofar9, so that people may look at it.

NB: Of course AGW has found similar tools in the past, when we were
not yet ready to appreciate them. Once we decide what we want we
should select the most suitable one.



           =============================
           On the use of uv-bricks (JEN)
	   =============================

JEN has started a document "on the use of uv-bricks in MeqTree
processing". They might turn out to be useful for more than just patch
prediction. Other possibilities are:

  -) Reduction/elimination of 'other-source' contamination in peeling.

  -) LSM subtraction without knowing the position and flux of every
  source individually. After all, we are not interested in those, just
  in their removal. 

  -) Selfcal without LSM: a form of weak redundancy, smoothing the
  rubber sheet. Especially around the phase centre.

The uv-brick is rapidly moving higher on the agenda....

	   ===================
           Short-term emphasis
	   ===================

As ever:

    -) Robustness of the Kernel: Exercise, exercise, exercise...!

    -) Canned forests (without LSM, for the moment: CPS-stage) 

    -) Water-hole:  

    -) Operation 343


MAB has started 'Operation 343' to give us a quick result on the
two-source 3c343 field. He will start with OMS's old meqsolve.g, and
add flagger nodes etc as needed. (Obviously, the MeqSolver problem
will have to be solved first). But the tree will be relatively simple
because no polarisation calibration is needed, only a complex gain per
X/Y receptor.  This operation will shake out many little wrinkles, and
give us the chance to assess the speed of the MeqTrees. OMS will stop
the kernel development for a few weeks, and will write documentation
of the existing system while being on standby for MAB.

The result of Operation 343 will be compared with the reductions of
the same field by Miriad (TAO), Aips++ (RJN) and NEWSTAR (AGB). It
will raise many issues in peeling/contamination.

In parallel, JEN will continue as planned with the more complex
CPS-trees for WRST polarisation calibration. RJN will concentrate on
LSM and uv-bricks, and MXM will work on MeqParms. All these are needed
for the next stage (M81 and beyond).



           ===================
           Medium-term program
	   ===================

Everyone has his/her own area, with a lot of freedom, and minimum
dependence on others. Together, but individually self-propelled, we
move towards the following targets:

    Feb) Central Point Source (CPS): Visualisation, flagging,
    calibration (incl bandpass and polarisation), source subtraction,
    uv-data correction, inspection of residual images. Canned trees
    for all these activities, with automatic adaption to WSRT MS, and
    standard node classes only. Measurement of MeqTree speed (and
    bottlenecks?). MeqParm visualisation.

       During this month, the water-hole should emerge, teeming with
       vigorous life: Waterlogged forests, and the water-tool. Early
       MeqParm fiddling.

    Feb/Mar) Two dominating sources (3c343): Simple LSM, peeling
    chain.  Estimation of 'other-source' contamination, and its effect
    on the selfcal solution.

    Apr) A more complicated field (M81): Adaptation to LSM. Beamshape
    solution, including off-axis polarisation (17 MHz standing wave).

    May) A complex field (3c84): 1:10.000.000. Prediction of extended
    sources: LSM patches and uvbricks. 

    Jun) A LFFE field with a bright source (3c147): Facet
    imaging.

    Jul) A LFFE field without a bright source: Transfer of calibrator
    MeqParm values. Solve for ionospheric phase gradients (the start
    of a 'minimum' ionospheric model).  .
