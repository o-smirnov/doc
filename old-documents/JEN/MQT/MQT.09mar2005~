           Meeting schedule
	   ================

Wednesday 15:00, Multi-Media Room.

Please prepare by reading this thoroughly.


           =======================================
	   Should we move the meeting to thursday?
           =======================================

We discussed this last week. The main argument is the availability of
MAB. Points against are: the hassle to re-book the multi-media room,
and the desire to keep the thursday for other activities. In addition,
the group meeting is probably not the best venue for a detailed
discussion of things like operation 343. So: the meeting will continue
to be held on wednesdays, at 15:00, with AGW included. 


           ================
           Topics this week
	   ================

Operation 343. See below. 


           ===================
           Operation 343 (MAB) 
           ===================

We identify the following steps:

   0) In order to get a result soon, the uv-data in the MS will be
   pre-corrected, using AIPS++:

      -) Multiply the corr.coeff with Tsys (from MS) and divide by
      Aeff to make Jy.

      -) Flagging, using the OMS autoflagger, followed by 4-corr
      equalisation of flagged points. Optionally, if available, use
      Adriaan's complex median over a 5-time-slot sliding window as a
      more sensitive alternative (not really needed for these data).

      -) Bandpass calibration, from channel-by-channel selfcal on the
      average amplitude over the entire 10-min calibrator data, using
      a point source model with spectral dependence. 

      -) Correct for telescope phases obtained from selfcal on
      calibrator observation.       

   1) Phase-only selfcal for one phase per dipole, using a sky model
   with two point sources (with apparent fluxes). This requires the
   solver to react to flags and fails, and will test GVD's DFT node.

   2) Peeling: Solve for separate complex gains in the direction of
   the two main sources. Various strategies can be compared.

   3) Take the 200 backgound sources into account, to get to the
   thermal noise. Ideally, an early version of the uv-brick will be
   ready for that. Use NVSS positions and fluxes, or apparent ones
   found in the residual image? Include WSRT primary beams? Solve for
   pointing errors?


In parallel, we need to address the problem of providing these
functions in the MeqTree system.

      -) Transfer of MeqParm values from calibrator observations to
      the reduction of science observations. This is mainly an
      adminsitrative problem, involving the names of tables and
      MeqParms.

      -) Develop the mechanism for specific nodes to obtain
      information from the MS, like Tsys, or the (RA, DEC) of the
      field centre, or the maximum baseline length.

      -) For bandpass calibration this will involve a 5th-order
      frequency polynomial over the centre section of the band (1%
      accuracy is enough). NB: The bandpass correction is associated
      with the receiver CHANNEL, not the frequency. In future we need
      a mapping node from channel to frequency (like MeqFreq...).


The idea is that, by the end of the operation 343, we have all the
necessary cps-trees for calibrator reduction.




	 ===========
         AGW program
	 ===========

AGW will return to Canada at the end of this week. During this visit,
the MeqTree visualisation scheme has matured to a level where it is
not only the cornerstone tool that we so urgently need, but also fun
to play with (very important). We hope that he will be allowed to
coninue as an external member of our group, so he will:

   -) Continue to react to visualisation requests via Bugzilla (bugs
   and enhancements). Also to generate new visualisation features as
   an active user (see below).

   -) Be in a position (able and available) to write new node classes
   and browser plugins.

   -) Maintain his entry-level Meqtree manual. 

This last week, he will make sure that his computing environment is
optimal for remote interaction across the ocean. However, he will only
be allowed to spend appreciable time on this if he can demonstrate the
advantages of the MeqTree system for DRAO purposes (e.g. simulations
for the LAR). This week, he will outline first generation of meqtrees
that he needs for that, which will probably be rather simialr the the
ones we need for operation 343.



           ================
           Water-hole (RXA)
           ================

RXA has laid the keel of a gui-based MeqTree builder (in Python). 
It looks very nice, and will be a great help to newcomers.

However, the tools for selecting and executing water-hole trees is
urgent. Especially the request editor, which should also be available
from the browser (re-execute mode) as a plugin.

JEN has pre-loaded canned forests to contribute. They are available on
lofar9: ~/LOFAR/CEP/CPA/PSS4/MeqGen/src/*.meqforest




           =============
           MeqParm (MXM)
	   =============

MXM has started on her MeqParm document. JEN has supplied some of the
input figures. By simply playing with existing trees and the browser,
she may already have identified the recent problem with the solver....

Her first node classes (MeqWSum and MeqWMean) have been checked in,
and appear to work. Bravo. We still need a dynamic way to modify the
weight vector. One solution is a special node that makes a weight
vector from their children, and passes it to its parent in the rider
of its result... (Good Design?). We need a similar thing for the
MeqSolver, to apply weights to the condeq equations.
 
The most effective start for the MeqParm project is probably a MeqParm
fiddler plugin (Python), which can be used stand-alone and from the
browser. Apart from modifying the coefficients of a particular MeqParm,
it can also visualise its current value, e.g. in a 3D plot. Onve it
exists in its basic from (and the Python hurdle is taken), it can grow
from there. As a byproduct, MXM, RXA and AGW can work develop their
browser plugins in parallel, while OM writes documentation on the
subject.


           ==============
	   uv-brick (RJN)
	   ==============

RJN will summarize the status.
   

	   ===================
           Visualisation (AGW)
	   ===================

AGW will report on the status.


           ==============================================
	   Local Sky Model (LSM) and related issues (RJN)
	   ==============================================

RJN has started on a document (with JEN) that describes the contents
and the various functions of the LSM.
 

           ===================== 
           Tree generation (JEN)
	   =====================

JEN has been feeding pre-loaded 'mqbm' (MeqBenchMark) trees to AGW,
for testing visualisation.  They are available to all and sundry in
the water-hole.

           ======================
	   Global Sky Model (TAO)
	   ======================

Very little work has gone into the GSM until now. The only thing we
know is that we will need one for LOFAR. We suspect that we need one
for serious use of the MeqTree system for WSRT observations. In any
case, a working prototype is needed before we start on the LOFAR GSM.

There are three main aspects to the GSM project:

  1) Designing and implementing it (and its interaction with the LSM)

  2) Filling it with initial data from existing surveys, especially
  combining observations at different times/freqs in funklets.

  3) Using it operationally.

It is time to start thinking about all that....



           ===================
           Facet imaging (WNB)
	   ===================

This is imaging in the narrow sense, i.e. just the transform of
'corrected' uv-data into residual image(s).  For the moment, we can
get by with the present AIPS++ imaging, but it is essential that
someone takes a hard look at the suitability in the medium term, and
eventually for LOFAR. WNB will get involved after in April, or
thereabouts.

	   ===================
           Short-term emphasis
	   ===================

As ever:

    -) Robustness of the Kernel: Exercise, exercise, exercise...!

    -) Canned forests (without LSM, for the moment: CPS-stage) 

    -) Water-hole:  

    -) Operation 343


MAB has started 'Operation 343' to give us a quick result on the
two-source 3c343 field. He will start with OMS's old meqsolve.g, and
add flagger nodes etc as needed. (Obviously, the MeqSolver problem
will have to be solved first). But the tree will be relatively simple
because no polarisation calibration is needed, only a complex gain per
X/Y receptor.  This operation will shake out many little wrinkles, and
give us the chance to assess the speed of the MeqTrees. OMS will stop
the kernel development for a few weeks, and will write documentation
of the existing system while being on standby for MAB.

The result of Operation 343 will be compared with the reductions of
the same field by Miriad (TAO), Aips++ (RJN) and NEWSTAR (AGB). It
will raise many issues in peeling/contamination.

In parallel, JEN will continue as planned with the more complex
CPS-trees for WRST polarisation calibration. RJN will concentrate on
LSM and uv-bricks, and MXM will work on MeqParms. All these are needed
for the next stage (M81 and beyond).



           ===================
           Medium-term program
	   ===================

Everyone has his/her own area, with a lot of freedom, and minimum
dependence on others. Together, but individually self-propelled, we
move towards the following targets:

    Feb) Central Point Source (CPS): Visualisation, flagging,
    calibration (incl bandpass and polarisation), source subtraction,
    uv-data correction, inspection of residual images. Canned trees
    for all these activities, with automatic adaption to WSRT MS, and
    standard node classes only. Measurement of MeqTree speed (and
    bottlenecks?). MeqParm visualisation.

       During this month, the water-hole should emerge, teeming with
       vigorous life: Waterlogged forests, and the water-tool. Early
       MeqParm fiddling.

    Feb/Mar) Two dominating sources (3c343): Simple LSM, peeling
    chain.  Estimation of 'other-source' contamination, and its effect
    on the selfcal solution.

    Apr) A more complicated field (M81): Adaptation to LSM. Beamshape
    solution, including off-axis polarisation (17 MHz standing wave).

    May) A complex field (3c84): 1:10.000.000. Prediction of extended
    sources: LSM patches and uvbricks. 

    Jun) A LFFE field with a bright source (3c147): Facet
    imaging.

    Jul) A LFFE field without a bright source: Transfer of calibrator
    MeqParm values. Solve for ionospheric phase gradients (the start
    of a 'minimum' ionospheric model).  .
