           ================
           Topics this week
	   ================

Operation 343. See below. 


           ===================
           Operation 343 (MAB) 
           ===================

Done:

  -) Tsys applied (needed new glish tool in AIPS++)

  -) Flagged with autoflagger (2%) 
       median abs(XY), abs(YX)

  -) Bandpass from 3c295 
       (AIPS++ knows its spectrum)
       separate factors per freq channel....

  -) MeqSolver:
     - flagged data are ignored 
       (but condeq has already made derivatives etc...)
     - use different version of makenorm() which only
       takes the (minority) of non-zero derivatives
     - if rank-deficient: sol_flag=F (in metrics?)
     - condeq FAIL (no data): not yet caught (OMS)

Next:

  -) cannibalising meqsolve.g for 343

  -) DFT nodes calculate u,v,w, from station positions. This requires
  a first step to create X,Y,Z MeqParm entries from the MS. In the
  future, we need another way to get info from the MS.

  -) Sky Model: 2 point sources (flux=1,0,0,0)
     Should be ~5 for 3c343.1 and ~1 (apparent) for 3c343

  -) Processing plan:
     - Fit StokesI of both sources (assume correct gain)
     - and also the phases (simultaneously?): orthogonal
     - independent phases for both sources 
     - The two phase-plots should be roughly equal
    
  -) NB: The phase solution requires a 30 sec snippets, so there will
  be 1440 polcs/antenna in the MeqParm table. The StokesI solution
  requires a super-snippet of 12 hrs, and solution for c00 only. The
  frequency-dependence will be linear over the domain, but MAB plans
  to work with a single freq channel first (efficiency).

  -) Obviously, we will gain a lot from planned improvements like the
  advanced MeqParm scheme, and from integration over larger cells
  (peeling). This will become abundantly clear in this exercise.

  -) MAB will try to di a first data-pass on thursday.


For reference, here is the 343 program again:

We identify the following steps:

   0) In order to get a result soon, the uv-data in the MS will be
   pre-corrected, using AIPS++:

      -) Multiply the corr.coeff with Tsys (from MS) and divide by
      Aeff to make Jy.

      -) Flagging, using the OMS autoflagger, followed by 4-corr
      equalisation of flagged points. Optionally, if available, use
      Adriaan's complex median over a 5-time-slot sliding window as a
      more sensitive alternative (not really needed for these data).

      -) Bandpass calibration, from channel-by-channel selfcal on the
      average amplitude over the entire 10-min calibrator data, using
      a point source model with spectral dependence. 

      -) Correct for telescope phases obtained from selfcal on
      calibrator observation.       

   1) Phase-only selfcal for one phase per dipole, using a sky model
   with two point sources (with apparent fluxes). This requires the
   solver to react to flags and fails, and will test GVD's DFT node.

   2) Peeling: Solve for separate complex gains in the direction of
   the two main sources. Various strategies can be compared.

   3) Take the 200 backgound sources into account, to get to the
   thermal noise. Ideally, an early version of the uv-brick will be
   ready for that. Use NVSS positions and fluxes, or apparent ones
   found in the residual image? Include WSRT primary beams? Solve for
   pointing errors?


In parallel, we need to address the problem of providing these
functions in the MeqTree system.

      -) Transfer of MeqParm values from calibrator observations to
      the reduction of science observations. This is mainly an
      adminsitrative problem, involving the names of tables and
      MeqParms.

      -) Develop the mechanism for specific nodes to obtain
      information from the MS, like Tsys, or the (RA, DEC) of the
      field centre, or the maximum baseline length.

      -) For bandpass calibration this will involve a 5th-order
      frequency polynomial over the centre section of the band (1%
      accuracy is enough). NB: The bandpass correction is associated
      with the receiver CHANNEL, not the frequency. In future we need
      a mapping node from channel to frequency (like MeqFreq...).


The idea is that, by the end of the operation 343, we have all the
necessary cps-trees for calibrator reduction.



           ================
           Water-hole (RXA)
           ================

RXA will report, also on tools and MeqMath classes


           =============

RJN will summarize the status, and demonstrate...

           Visualisation (AGW)
	   ===================

AGW will report on the status.


           ==============================================
	   Local Sky Model (LSM) and related issues (RJN)
	   ==============================================

RJN will develop that as needed in the uv-brick excercise
 

           ===================== 
           Tree generation (JEN)
	   =====================

JEN has been feeding pre-loaded 'mqbm' (MeqBenchMark) trees to AGW,
for testing visualisation.  They are available to all and sundry in
the water-hole.

           ======================
	   Global Sky Model (TAO)
	   ======================

Very little work has gone into the GSM until now. The only thing we
know is that we will need one for LOFAR. We suspect that we need one
for serious use of the MeqTree system for WSRT observations. In any
case, a working prototype is needed before we start on the LOFAR GSM.

There are three main aspects to the GSM project:

  1) Designing and implementing it (and its interaction with the LSM)

  2) Filling it with initial data from existing surveys, especially
  combining observations at different times/freqs in funklets.

  3) Using it operationally.

It is time to start thinking about all that....



           ===================
           Facet imaging (WNB)
	   ===================

This is imaging in the narrow sense, i.e. just the transform of
'corrected' uv-data into residual image(s).  For the moment, we can
get by with the present AIPS++ imaging, but it is essential that
someone takes a hard look at the suitability in the medium term, and
eventually for LOFAR. WNB will get involved after in April, or
thereabouts.

	   ===================
           Short-term emphasis
	   ===================

As ever:

    -) Robustness of the Kernel: Exercise, exercise, exercise...!

    -) Canned forests (without LSM, for the moment: CPS-stage) 

    -) Water-hole:  

    -) Operation 343




           ===================
           Medium-term program
	   ===================

Everyone has his/her own area, with a lot of freedom, and minimum
dependence on others. Together, but individually self-propelled, we
move towards the following targets:

    Feb) Central Point Source (CPS): Visualisation, flagging,
    calibration (incl bandpass and polarisation), source subtraction,
    uv-data correction, inspection of residual images. Canned trees
    for all these activities, with automatic adaption to WSRT MS, and
    standard node classes only. Measurement of MeqTree speed (and
    bottlenecks?). MeqParm visualisation.

       During this month, the water-hole should emerge, teeming with
       vigorous life: Waterlogged forests, and the water-tool. Early
       MeqParm fiddling.

    Feb/Mar) Two dominating sources (3c343): Simple LSM, peeling
    chain.  Estimation of 'other-source' contamination, and its effect
    on the selfcal solution.

    Apr) A more complicated field (M81): Adaptation to LSM. Beamshape
    solution, including off-axis polarisation (17 MHz standing wave).

    May) A complex field (3c84): 1:10.000.000. Prediction of extended
    sources: LSM patches and uvbricks. 

    Jun) A LFFE field with a bright source (3c147): Facet
    imaging.

    Jul) A LFFE field without a bright source: Transfer of calibrator
    MeqParm values. Solve for ionospheric phase gradients (the start
    of a 'minimum' ionospheric model).  .
