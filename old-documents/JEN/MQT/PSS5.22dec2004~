	   =================================
           Coordinate-conversion nodes (RXA)
	   =================================


RXA will propose (and then implement) a small set of nodes with
hard-coded celestial coordinate-conversions. (It does not seem a good
idea to have AIPS++ measures inside nodes). This is very much an issue
for canned forests: The MS contains a reference to J2000 or b1950,
while the sources in the GSM/LSM may have a different coordinate
system. Moreover, we now give the source RA in radians, which may not
be the best possible choice, because this depends on Dec. (Dec in
radians is OK)


           =============
	   System Issues
	   =============

OMS has prepared a Bugzilla bug-reporting thingy, and can make it
available when we decide that the moment has come. I think it has.

           ==============================
	   GSM/LSM source parametrization
           ==============================

RJN has been experimenting with expressions for the spectral shape of
a radio source that would be valid the entire WSRT-LOFAR range. The
NEWSTAR use of a single spectral index (I=I0*(f/f0)^-alpha) is clearly
not sufficient. He first tried the simplest possible approach within
our current system, i.e. a spectral index alpha(f) which is itself a
funklet(polc)  with more than one f-coefficient. This does not produce
a reasonable fit, so he started experimenting with more complicated
functions, in which the 4-5 parameters are separate MeqParms. This was
very successful (results will be shown). 

We should consider the pros and cons of defining a specific funklet
for this generalised spectral index. This would considerably reduce
the number of nodes. It will also be a good exercise of the new
cell-dimension scheme that OMS has implemented.... 

This is an important issue for GSM/LSM. Our concept of storing
MeqTrees as part of the source-definition will make it the most
versatile radio-catalog in existence. Moreover, if we have a single
funklet for the entire frequency-range, we will be able to tie
observations with randomly spaced sub-bands together, and win S/N in
the process because we solve for a minimal nr of parameters.

As a byproduct, RJN has acquired experience with building MeqTrees and
solving for MeqParms. He also pioneered new ways of getting data in,
by asking OMS to allow the MeqConstant to take a vellset value. This
is a bit of a kludge, because it only works if the requested cells are
the correct shape, and ars defined on the correct grid (which may be
irregular). More thought has to be put into this.



	   ===========
           New recruit
	   ===========

We get a new RSW colleague in the project. He/she will be full-time
PSS, stationed in Dwingeloo, and will concentrate on MeqParm issues
(MeqParm table tools, and the class itsef).

After Algemene Zaken have moved to a new portacabin in Q12005, there
will be more room for the PSS team in the main building in Dwingeloo.
I hope that we can get a few rooms close together.  


	   ===================================
	   A better name for the P[I]SS system
	   ===================================

I offer a bottle of Good Stuff for the winner of our new-name
competition. 

  - RXA: Jones Equation Nodes (JEN)               (rejected, of course)
  - RXA: Arbitrary Measurement Equation Nodes (AMEN)
  - RXA: Flexible Measurement Equation Solver (FlexMeqs)
  - RXA: Fleqs or Meqs
  - RXA: A logo, which my mailer could not reproduce.
  - RJN: SElfcal module for Solving Arbitrary M.E. (SESAME)
  - OMS: SecSy: Selfcal System 
  - GVD: FRAMES: Flexible Radio Astronomy M.E. Solver
  - GVD: FLAMES: idem, without radio
  - GVD: GAMES:  idem, with Generic i.s.o. Flexible
  - OMS: TIMBER: Trees for Interactive Modelling, Building, Evaluation
                 and Reduction
                 Can optionally be extended to TIMBERLAND via Large Astronomical Numeric 
                 Data (or something along those lines).
                 Timber Is a Model Building and Evaluation Resources
  - AGW: FIDO: FIx Data and Observations
  - JEN: Panther: (sleek, fast, versatile)
  - AGW: FRODO - Flexible Radiotelescope Observations Doctor and Organizer
  -      FRODO - Flexible Radiotelescope Observations DOctor
  - GVD: FAMES   Flexible Astronomical Measurement Equation Solver
         POFES   POlicy Free Equation Solver
         GAVES   Generic Astronomical Visualiser and Equation Solver


GVD: Before deciding on a new name, it should be checked (via Google)
if it does not exist already. Also we must make sure it does not mean
something bad in, say, French or Spanish. For example, I noticed that
FLAMES is the name of a VLT instrument.  TIMBER is the name of an XML
data base system.

Anyone else? I want to change by January 1st 2005.



	   ===================
           Short-term emphasis
	   ===================

Three points:

    -) Robustness of the Kernel: Exercise, exercise, exercise...!
    NB: OMS will start a kernel bug/feature reporting system.

    -) Canned trees (without LSM, for the moment). See below.

    -) Water-hole. See below.


I want these three things to be in a workable state BEFORE the
Christmas holidays. This will allow me to generate and test most of
the canned forests for our focus program over Christmas, so that we
can start on real data (3c343) in the new year.



	   =============================
           Visualisation: Work-plan AGW:
	   =============================

We did a little more trans-atlantic wrangling, and things are coming
together in the new scheme. I hope that we can show some demos at both
sides of the Ocean. AGW will check in his new classes, and JEN will 
use them today.

In a different vein: JEN has developed an automatic tree-plotter. It
still only works on his (Glish) MeqSubTree objects, but it will also
be possible to plot a tree from the nodelist obtained from the kernel.
The biggest problem turns out to be to divide the tree in branches of
a manageable size, which can be plotted separately. Examples will be
shown.

           Water-hole (RXA)
           ================


RXA will report on the status.
