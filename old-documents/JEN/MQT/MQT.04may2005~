 -) Things are going rather well at the mment. A copy of my quarterly

           =====================================
	   Preparation for LOFAR calibration day
           =====================================

This is planned for the beginning of June (thursday 2nd?). The program
is still being negotiated. The main topic will be LOFAR calibration, but
there are two slots for MeqTree-related talks:

  -) MAB will talk about our 343 project. Hopefully he will be able to
  show an image which is at least as good as the results obtained with
  the various other packages. In any case he will emphasize that he
  uses a more complex M.E. than the others (incl the 17 MHHz off-axis
  ripple), and that the speed is satisfactory. The entire MeqTree team
  is on standby to support his efforts where necessary.

  -) JEN will talk about the status of the MeqTree project in general,
  and the CPS-project in particular.  Borrowing a military metaphore,
  the 343 project is our 'flying column', while the CPS-project
  'brings up the rear'. The plan is to demonstrate an OPERATIONAL set
  of of canned trees for reducing the most popular WSRT calibrator
  sources. In addition, if possible, we will also show the status of
  the next step: predicting extended sources with uv-bricks.

The CPS project limits itself to Central Point Sources (CPS) because
they do not require the complexity of an LSM or peeling, while still
being potentially interesting for WSRT operations (provided they offer
functionality that is better or more convenient than existing). 

An operational set of canned CPS trees for reduction of WSRT
calibrator observations must have the following features:

  1) Stream control tool (RXA): This allows the user to select a tree,
  and associate it with a MS. It also allows the modification of the
  sensible defaults of a few parameters like (freq,time) tile-size,
  ifr selection (TaQL), MS columns to be used for I/O, etc. 

  1a) The stream control tool should also allow the use to specify
  what to do with the results. E.g. make a map of the residual
  uv-data, or display the estimated MeqParm values.

  2) A set of canned trees for the various sources, for various
  operations:

     -) Source model, with frequency-dependent S.I. so that it is
     valid for all WSRT frequencies (RJN).

     -) Simple flagging (with corr equalisation).

     -) Visual inspection (using the browser/fiddler).

     -) Bandpass calibration.

     -) Tsys application (requires obtaining info from MS)

     -) Solving for phase/gain

     -) Solving for dang, dell, PZD, Faraday rotation.

     -) Subtraction of the CPS calibrator source

     -) Correction of the (residual) uv-data

     -) Inspection of the result(s).

  3) Some tools for inspecting the estimated MeqParm values, and to
  dispose of them (MXM).

       Calibration Studies
       ===================
       J.E. Noordam, April 2005

While most of the labours of this workpackage are presently going into
developing a prototype calibration system, there has also been
progress in identifying new data-processing concepts:

  1) A 'minimum ionospheric model' has been formulated, which
  describes the phaenomenological side of the ionosphere that is
  important for LOFAR calibration with a minimum number of parameters.
  The calibration system may dynamically adapt the model by increasing
  (or decreasing) the number of terms. It does this by optimising the
  consistency of the solution on multiple calibrator sources in the
  field.

  2) The concept of a uv-brick was developed for the prediction of
  extended sources. It now turns out that it can also be used for
  other things, like the exploitation of redundant baselines, or the
  application of image-plane effects.

  3) One of the bottlenecks will be the subtraction of large numbers
  of foreground sources from the uv-data. Since we are not interested
  in these sources themselves, it would be a huge saving in processing
  if we could somehow 'filter' them out collectively. If that is
  fundamentally possible, uv-bricks should play a role in it.


The Prototype Selfcal System (PSS) project has been renamed the
MeqTree project. The MeqTree system for implementing arbitrary
Measurement Equations, and solving for their parameters, is coming
along very nicely. A basic set of node classes (LEGO blocks) is
available, and also the tools to generate 'forests' of sufficient
complexity. Most importantly, the solvers produce correct results that
are well understood. The important MeqParm class is rapidly evolving,
together with tools to inspect and manipulate parameter values.

Early tests have demonstrated that MeqTree data reduction of the same
dataset is at least as fast as other packages, with the exception of
MIRIAD. However, there are many possibilities for optimisation yet to
be explored: caching, peeling, uvbricks, etc. Ultimately, the system
will be limited by other modules, like the AIPS++ MS and imaging.   

Since it is less than two years before LOFAR will start observations,
the highest priority now is to demonstrate the powers and weaknesses
of the calibration system on real data. An important by-product will
be the involvement of experienced astronomers in excersizing the
system doing their own front-line research. We have embarked on the
following program, in which each item will excersize particular
elements of the system:

  -) Central Point Sources (CPS). For reduction of bright calibrator
  sources, e.g. in WSRT operations. Especially WSRT polarisation.

  -) 3C343 (WSRT, 21cm): Two dominating point-sources. Needs peeling,
  and a simple Local Sky Model (LSM).

  -) M81: Needs the prediction of extended sources: uv-bricks. 

  -) XXX: Update of LSM source parameters from residual images.

  -) LFFE (WSRT): Needs ionospheric model. Low S/N, so it needs the
  transfer of calibrator values. Needs facet imaging.

  -) 3c84: Very complex field. Dynamic range > 1.000.000. 

After successful completion of this program, the MeqTree system will
be essentially mature.

Finally, some important remarks:

  a) Until recently, the result of a MeqNode was the equivalent of a
  scalar variable.  This has now been generalised, so that a node can
  now represent an n-dimenional 'tensor'. All mathematical operations
  apply, and there are even some matrix operations. Very importantly,
  the information needed for the calculation of derivatives for the
  solver is handled transparently. The introduction of tensor nodes
  has greatly reduced the number of nodes, and thus improved the
  efficiency and tractability of a tree. The fact that the entire
  operation was done in a week is a testimony to the 'cleanliness' of
  the MeqTree kernel.

  b) A MeqTree forest is controlled and monitored from a (Python) tree
  browser, which turns out to be extra-ordinarily useful. It might be
  the nucleus of a totally new kind of user interface.  In the
  meantime, it is an absolutely essential development tool, because it
  allows the inspection and monitoring of each individual node, at any
  point of the reduction process.

  c) The MeqTree system offers an unprecedented range of visualisation
  'windows' on the processing. Apart from being able to pause the
  system and to inspect and visualise the result of any node, there
  are ways to design built-in views that combine the results of
  specific subsets of nodes. The latter are then be used to monitor
  the progress and the health of the processing.

Especially the last two aspects might be considered for joint research
projects with external partners like university groups.
