OMS: Here's a derived submission then: TIMBA (e.g. Trees for Interactive 
Model Building & Analysis). Why this is a good name:

(a) Easy to say, rolls off the tongue;
(b) Has an obvious phonetic connection to "timber" and thus trees;
(c) Has positive aesthetic connotations, being apparently the name for 
the Cuban variant of salsa music:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timba

<<<Also different from salsa is the frequent shift from major 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_key> to minor 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_scale> keys (and vice versa), the 
highly complex rhythmic arrangements (often based on santería 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santer%EDa> or abakuá 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Abaku%E1&action=edit> 
rhythms), the shifts in speed and the large number of orchestrated 
breaks, or ‘bloques’.>>>

<<<Though timba is considered to be a form of popular music, the 
technical mastery of timba is only possibly through highly trained 
musicians, who have solid backgrounds in classical music and jazz, as 
well as traditional Cuban music 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuban_music>.>>>

<<<Though timba is not overly popular in the world-wide salsa scene 
(many dancers considering it to be difficult to dance), it has found a 
niche among a growing number of fans and has been influential amongst 
Cuban-American and European salsa musicians.>>>

Sounds just like a metaphor for our system, no? ;)


Anyone else? I want to change by January 1st 2005.



           =================================
	   Solving for LSM source parameters
	   =================================

Status by RJN

Including spectral-index

LSM module

Connecting LSM to canned forest


	   ===================
           Short-term emphasis
	   ===================

Three points:

    -) Robustness of the Kernel: Exercise, exercise, exercise...!
    NB: OMS will start a kernel bug/feature reporting system.

    -) Canned trees (without LSM, for the moment). See below.

    -) Water-hole. See below.


I want these three things to be in a workable state BEFORE the
Christmas holidays. This will allow me to generate and test most of
the canned forests for our focus program over Christmas, so that we
can start on real data (3c343) in the new year.
 


           ================
           Water-hole (RXA)
           ================


RXA will report on the status.

List of available trees...


           =================
	   Streaming uv-data
           =================


Today Ger de Bruyn gave us a demo of the AIPS++ uv-data vieuwer. It is
possible to load significant amounts of uv-data into memory, and then
let it stream past in any dimensions that you select. He chose
frequency channel (horizontal) vs baseline (vertical) in some order,
and showed a movie along the time-axis. The data happily streamed
past, showing all kinds of interesting features that astronomers want
to see (this would be perfect for the coffee-machine monitor!).

Rene Vermeulen suggested that it should actually be combined with an
interactive flagger, where the user can fiddle the thresholds etc and
see what happens. 

I draw two conclusions from all this:

  1) AIPS++ is getting its act together, which is good for us because
     we will be leaning on them for some time to come.

  2) It is not often that you see astronomers salivating. When it
     happens, we should pay attention. 

We can do this too, including the interactive flagger (which the
AIPS++ setup will not easily allow, because they get their speed from
pre-loading the data, and doing any operations on it). Already we have
the concept of multiple built-in viewers (dataCollect nodes that
collect data from an arbitrary set of child nodes). We can have one of
these before and after a flagger, and allow the user to fiddle the
MeqParm (or the MeqConstant) that controls the flagger threshold(s)
etc. So our only concern here is speed, both Oleg's data streaming,
the publishing, and Tony's display of the result. Maybe we need
something extra, in addition to the wonderful stuff that Tony is
producing now. Let us discuss this at our next videocon next week,
Tony.



	 ======================
         Solver and supersolver
	 ======================


On another subject: Ger van Diepen and I had a discussion about
solvers and super-solvers. He will summarize this in a separate email.

Both these issues should find their way into Bugzilla, of course.




	   ===================
           Visualisation: AGW:
	   ===================

Tony will produce a consistent set of rules for the behaviour of his
plot-record extraction scheme.

He will also define a set of colors and styles that his program will
recognise, and convert to the corresponding colors/styles of either
Qwt, HippoDraw, or whatever plotting program is appropriate. Perhaps
the PGPLOT set is a good start, but it could be a little richer than
that. Note that 'styles' covers point-styles (plus, cross, diamond
etc) as well as line-styles (solid, dashed, dotted). The specified
style thus determines whether a set of (x,y) coordinate-pairs is
plotted as a line connecting them, or as a set of individual points.


JEN: I will now develop a standard solver-unit, any number of which
can be plugged into the s2s tree. Each has two visualiser-units
attached to its input reqseq, one for watching the relevant condeqs,
and another one for visualising the values of the relevant meqparms.
The two visualisers are versions of a standard visualisation unit that
can be used to plug nuil-in views into any point of the tree.  All
solver-units and visualiser units are easily accessible from the top
of the browser, where they can be (de-)activated at will.
