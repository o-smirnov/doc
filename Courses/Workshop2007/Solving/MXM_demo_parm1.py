# Comments:
#
# The final difference between the shape_parm and the polc_parm can be explained by the fact that for
# solvable polcs per default the lower right triangle of coefficients is kept to 0.
# i.e. all c_nm with (n+m) > max(n,m). (0-based)
#
# You can check the solution by looking at the coefficients of the funklet in the record browser or in the meptable
# if you set the 6th coefficient of the polc_parm to 0. instead of 0.00001, you should get a near perfect solution
