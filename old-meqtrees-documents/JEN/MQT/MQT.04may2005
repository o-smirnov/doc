 -) Continuing our preparation for our splash at the next LOFAR
 Calibration Day, in the beginning of June. 




           =====================================
	   Preparation for LOFAR calibration day
           =====================================

This is planned for TUESDAY MAY 31st. The program is still being
negotiated. The main topic will be LOFAR calibration, but there are
two slots for MeqTree-related talks:

  -) MAB will talk about our 343 project. Hopefully he will be able to
  show an image which is at least as good as the results obtained with
  the various other packages. In any case he will emphasize that he
  uses a more complex M.E. than the others (incl the 17 MHHz off-axis
  ripple), and that the speed is satisfactory (even before we start
  optimising seriously). The entire MeqTree team is on standby to
  support his efforts where necessary.

  -) JEN will talk about the status of the MeqTree project in general,
  and the CPS-project in particular.  Borrowing a military metaphore,
  the 343 project is our 'flying column', while the CPS-project
  'brings up the rear'. The plan is to demonstrate an OPERATIONAL set
  of canned trees for reducing the most popular WSRT calibrator
  sources. In addition, if possible, we will also show the status of
  the next step: predicting extended sources with uv-bricks.

  -) In the context of our official workpackage 'Calibration Studies',
  JEN will also present the latest version of the 'minimum ionosphere
  model'. This includes a discussion of phase tracking, and the phase
  locking procedure.



	===============
        The 343 project
	===============


This has its own momentum. The most important issues are:

  1) Quality of the result. This should be compared with the results
  on the same object in Miriad, Newstar, AIPS, BBS etc.

  2) Speed. It is important to make clear that MeqTree reduction is
  already as fast as other packages, even behore we have started
  optimising in earnest. Of course the comparison should be made when
  doing the same operations: often we are doing more sophisticated
  things than are possible elsewhere.

      a) OMS has solved the caching optimisation problem (for the
      moment)

      b) MAB and OMS are working on a scheme where the sorted MS data
      is written into a 'flat' file, so that the next pass through the
      data will be very much faster. This scheme applies to input data
      and output data (residuals, flags etc).

      c) We have identified a number of areas where we may increase
      the speed in the future. (But remember the First Law: "Premature
      optimisation is the root of all evil"). The most important is
      parallelisation, which we will address in the fall (this summer
      we do the tree definition language, to allow users to define
      complicated trees themselves). Others possibilities are domain
      resampling (using fewer, larger cells) and optimisation of
      vellsmath, especially in tensor nodes.

      d) There are interesting developments in the BBS project also.
      GVD has (partly) parallellised his PSS3 code, and John Romein is
      thinking about a code optimisation scheme, which could be
      applied to specific branches of the M.E. tree. The ultimate
      answer might be MeqTrees that contain highly optimised
      super-nodes, e.g. entire station branches.

  3) The utilised Measurement Equation. MAB is solving for the real
  and imaginary parts of the 4 elements of the 2x2 Jones matrices.
  This is the simplest possible M.E. (The CPS project explores more
  complex M.E.'s, which models specific effects like dipole angle
  errors, etc).



	===============
        The CPS project
	===============


The CPS project limits itself to Central Point Sources (CPS) because
they do not require the complexity of an LSM or peeling, while still
being potentially interesting for WSRT operations (provided they offer
functionality that is better or more convenient than existing). 

An OPERATIONAL set of canned CPS trees for reduction of WSRT
calibrator observations must have the following features:

  1) Stream control tool (RXA): This allows the user to select a tree,
  and associate it with a MS. It also allows the modification of the
  sensible defaults of a few parameters like (freq,time) tile-size,
  ifr selection (TaQL), MS columns to be used for I/O, etc. 

      a) The stream control tool should also allow the use to specify
      what to do with the results. E.g. make a map of the residual
      uv-data, or display the estimated MeqParm values.... 

      b) OMS has smoothed the path for RXA by providing some templates
      to work on.

  2) Bookmarks (OMS) in the forest state record, which define the
  placement of the state of various nodes on one or more browser
  pages. This saves a lot of clicking, and considerably lowers the
  threshold.

  3) MeqParm fiddler (MXM). This is being polished into a remarkably
  useful tool.

  4) A set of canned trees (JEN) for the various sources, for various
  operations. There will be trees to do these operations separately,
  but also trees where these operations are cascaded. JEN is busily
  rewriting to accomodate tensor nodes, which are thoroughly tested in
  the process. The following operations can be distinguished:

     -) Predefined source models for 10-20 popular calibrator sources.
     They should have frequency-dependent S.I. so that they are valid
     for all WSRT frequencies (RJN).

        a) We discussed various ways how the same tree might be used
        with different calibrator sources. The parameters of the
        latter would be in a table (a step towards a LSM).

     -) Simple flagging (with equalisation over all 4 corrs).

        a) AIPS++ has the possibility (built by OMS) to give a summary
        of all the flags....

     -) Visual inspection (using the browser/fiddler).

     -) Bandpass calibration.

        a) Is it possible to specify the central part of the band in
        the forest state record? This is useful for trees that are
        specially for bandpass calibration. How are these bandpass
        parameter values transferred to other trees?

     -) Tsys application (requires obtaining info from MS)

        a) At this moment, the trees automatically reads the telescope
        positions from the MS, using the OMS Python script. This
        works, but must be fully tested. To read Tsys info, a special
        bit of C++ must be written, and another Python script. How
        important is this?

     -) Solving for phase/gain

     -) Solving for dang, dell, PZD, Faraday rotation (RM). This is
     where we can really provide some value. The ideal is to provide a
     single tree for doing the entire WSRT calibration in one pass, on
     a SINGLE calibrator source. 

     -) Subtraction of the CPS calibrator source

     -) Correction of the (residual) uv-data

     -) Inspection of the result(s).

  4) Some tools for inspecting (summaries of) the estimated MeqParm
  values, and to dispose of them (MXM). Astronomers like to look at
  plots as a function of time and freq. RXA will show MXM some PLUVO
  plots, as an example of what will be needed in the future.

  5) Supporting documents. I am thinking about an explanation of
  polarisation calibration (i.e. what the plots mean). MAB could do
  the same for the 343 project. We should also put stuff on our wiki
  page.
