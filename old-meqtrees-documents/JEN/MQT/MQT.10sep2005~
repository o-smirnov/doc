Wednesday 15:30, Multi-Media Room.

Please prepare by reading this thoroughly.



           ================
           Topics this week
	   ================

 - MG scripts (contributions!): JEN will demo

   - NB: Put considerations and other comment in the scripts!
   -     They are the most readily accessible source of specific info.
   - NB: We need rules about repairing and checking in other people's scripts...

 - Official objects (e.g. sixpack): Sarod will explain

 - LSM (Sarod will demo)

 - LAR (AGW)

 - perverse couplings? (qt from Timba.mqds, etc) 

 - The new machines? (OMS)

 - Towards a family of funklets (MXM)



      ===================
      Testing environment
      ===================

MG-based: what is needed?



     ================================================================
     Towards operational use of MeqTrees in WSRT calibrator reduction. 
     ================================================================

This is an important element of the process to get our stuff
excersized, understood and coveted. 

   -) We need a MINIMUM basic but useful book-keeping system around
   the use of Meqtrees for reduction 'projects' (see below). It should
   allow the independent use of MeqTrees, but also have an interface
   that allows embedding into overall observatory systems.

   -) JEN has made available a set of TDL scripts for WSRT calibrator
   reduction trees. More are easily produced (and edited!).

   -) Proto-LSM with WSRT calibrator sources 
 
   -) System temperature. Getting info from MS

   -) Bandpass. Caused some trouble before...

   -) Flagging.... 
   
   -) Memory nodes needed (OMS)
 
   -) Speed....

   -) The group in Westerbork will take steps to make sure that
   MeqTrees can run there (AIPS++ version etc). In the mean-time, they
   can be used in Dwingeloo.
